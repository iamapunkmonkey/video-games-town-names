Random English Town Names
-------------------------

I find OpenTTD's built-in English name generators unsatisfying - constructions
like "Rordford" and "Donfington" tend to be awkward to pronounce; in general,
I felt I could do better.  The prefix-suffix method for constructing place
names was obvious, straightforward and as effective for England as it would be
for anywhere else in the world; I just needed better morphemes.

Ross Wittenham's Random English Village Name Generator turned out to be
exactly what I needed.  I augmented his own lists with a few items from the
Wikipedia page "List of generic forms in place names in the United Kingdom"
which felt conspicuously absent from Ross' page. and reduced the incidence of
what I call "prewords" like Little and Stoney - Ross is specifically trying to
evoke Little England tweeness, whereas I just want plausible fake toponymy.

I considered adding "postwords", but I couldn't think of many other than
"Regis" and I couldn't find a good algorithm to generate satisfying names
without also producing warts like "Royal Exton Regis".  Prewords and postwords
don't seem to mix well in general.
